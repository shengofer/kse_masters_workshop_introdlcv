# kse_masters_workshop_introdlcv
This is a repo for Workshop of my Course "Introduction to Deep Learning and Computer Vision" to the Master of Business and Management in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics Program (MBAI) students.

During the Course students without advance knowledge of programming will learn how to build an Object Classification Model using crapped data from the internet. 
I hope they will come up with great and exciting projects. 

During the workshop we will use Google Colab. 
It is a great tool for training ML model, as it allows using GPU Tesla K80, that perfectly fits for our research purpose.
Also, we will use FastAI [https://github.com/fastai/fastai] library. 
The fastai library simplifies training fast and accurate neural nets using modern best practices.
